# Due date calculator

Due date calculator Vue 3 beta application using the composition API.\
With an AngularJS, Angular, Vue 2 and React version < 16.8 background I first thought Vue 3 Composition API was a neat idea. At that moment, I didn't know it was just a copy of React Hooks which was actually the neat idea.
